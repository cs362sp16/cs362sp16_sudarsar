I compared my code with Dennis. The code failed because we were getting different scores and different
winners as well. I'm not exacly sure of the reason. There were a lot of differences in the implementations 
of our codes. It is pretty difficult to find out who was right. This is not the best case for using differential 
testing because, there are a lot of differences in the implementation code; especially owing to the usage of random 
numbers in the the implementation. Also, there are a lot of cards to chose from which makes it hard to choose 
the same cards in both the programs. I also noticed a bug in the feast which I changed to prevent an infinite loop.
My program has a 67.5% code coverage and Dennis' code has a coverage of 50.9%. I'm not really sure what's causing
this discrepancy in the code coverages but since we can't really do anything about it, I just thought I should 
put it here.
