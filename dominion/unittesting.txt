I'm averaging 82% code coverage. It's interesting that I can never get 100% code 
coverage because if the test passes, the lines that deal with the test failure don't 
run. If the test fails, the lines that deal with test success don't run. So, there is 
no way to get 100%. Moreover, I felt that my code coverage a false high because I don't 
think I testing every line of the code.
