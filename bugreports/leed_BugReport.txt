While testing Leed's code, I found an error in his implementation of adventurer card.
I noticed when running the random tester on his code, the output values showed that
the handCount of the player does not decrease. I narrowed down the problem on using 
print statements in his code. If running right, the state->handCount value should 
decrement by 1. However, since this code does not do it, when the card drawn is not 
gold or silver or copper, the handCount still remains the same. Fixing this code is 
more of understanding that the decrement statement has to go in place. So all that 
is needed to be done is to reduce the handCount of the current player by 1.
