While testing pengs' code using the random tester, I noticed that his code
for steward card does not discard the right number of cards. The card should 
actually discard 2 cards, but the way the code is implemented, only one card 
is discarded. The output from the random tester showed that everytime the random
tester encountered this card, only one card was discarded. This isn't a severe 
error and it can be fixed by a pretty easy solution of calling the discardCard
function one more time with the arguments handPos, currentPlayer, state and 0.
