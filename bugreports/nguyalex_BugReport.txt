While testing Alex's dominion code using random testers, I noticed that
his code kept hanging at random times. I narrowed the bug down to feast card 
and finding this was relatively easy because, the output showed the last 
card to execute in the random testing was always the feast card. By using print
statements, I was able to narrow down the problem to the if statement where the 
user tries to buy one card. There is an infinite loop because the code does not
provide a way for the program to get out of the loop. Although this is a frequently
occuring problem in random testing, it was relatively easy to solve. By adding x=0
inside the if statement, you can provide the program a chance to get out of the 
infinite loop once the code in the if statement has executed.
